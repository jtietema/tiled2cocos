tiled2cocos Quick Start
=======================

This project's aim is to create a very easy to use drop-in module for cocos2d that takes care of
deserializing your Tiled map for you.

To get the appropriate MapLayer object for your Tiled map that can be rendered directly into
a scene, proceed as follows:

    import tiled2cocos
    map_layer = tiled2cocos.load_map('path/to/file.tmx')

As explained at http://cocos2d.org/doc/api/cocos.tiles-module.html, you can then draw your map onto
the screen using a ScrollingManager instance, which ensures that your map can scroll and its
bounds are respected:

    from cocos import tiles
    from cocos.director import director
    from cocos.scene import Scene

    manager = tiles.ScrollingManager()
    manager.append(map_layer)

    director.run(Scene(manager))

There, all done!

Any comments or bug reports are very welcome, but please use the issue tracker at
http://bitbucket.org/maikg/tiled2cocos/issues/.

I hope you enjoy this module and that it saves you some time when developing your game!
